🧠 Time Series Forecasting with XGBoost
Personal Project | Advanced Machine Learning | Python

This project demonstrates a robust pipeline for forecasting future values in a time series dataset using XGBoost, one of the most powerful gradient boosting frameworks available. It’s designed to handle real-world challenges in temporal data modelling, such as non-stationarity, seasonality, and lag-based dependencies.

📌 Key Highlights:
  ✅ End-to-end pipeline from raw data ingestion to final forecasting and evaluation
  🧮 Feature Engineering: creation of lag features, rolling statistics, date/time decompositions
  ⏱ Custom Time Series Cross-Validation to avoid data leakage and ensure realistic validation
  📊 Model Interpretability: SHAP values and feature importance analysis to understand driver variables
  🔁 Reusable Framework for time series problems in finance, demand prediction, IoT, and more

🔧 Tech Stack
  Python (pandas, numpy, scikit-learn)
  XGBoost
  Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualisation)
  SHAP (for model interpretation)
  Jupyter Notebook
